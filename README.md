# Read_The_Room
React Native Discord API Wrapper for multiple user playlist creation

This project was a stackathon project over the course of 4 days. I Integrated the Spotify API with a Firebase database
allowing multiple users to manipuate the same playlist.

Requires a Spotify premium account for the host of the playlist. Non premium accounts can log in and join a room.

Main files are in the screens folder. Home Screen handles all login functionality, and Links screen handles all
Playlist manipulation. 

This was a fun experience to explore a new API and how they handle authentication and streaming.

Potential future points of access might be to stream that music (maybe even to all clients?), automatically populate 
playlists based on all users preferences, and passive room joining.
